## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Team Leader and Problem Solver that leads your teams to success. I focus on choosing technologies that accelerate development over time and by guiding teams down the most efficient path to the goal.

My journey in software started in university when doing some summer work for my Physics professor between my third and fourth years, messing around with Matlab. What piqued my interest then has blossomed into a career more than 12 years later, centered around web development. 

I have seen front-end development frameworks evolve from PHP to Backbone, to Angular and React. I have dabbled with static site generators such as 11ty and others. I have struggled with the various frameworks but yet have not seen one framework emerge as the de-facto choice. 

Currently, I am leading Granola's front-end product to success. We chose Rust (statically compiled language) and the Leptos framework, which compiles to WebAssembly. This choice has accelerated our development of the product both initially and through several large-scale refactorings.

But, crucially, collaborating with the back-end team by discussing and documenting issues, and keeping focused on our MVP has led to an efficient pursuit of the delivery.
